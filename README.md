## Idea

_This project marked the beginning of my journey with React, where I explored modern technologies like toolkit, among others. Additionally, there's an API integrated into the project (not developed by me). Through this endeavor, I've refined my skills within a new ecosystem and I'm excited to showcase the fruits of my labor._
